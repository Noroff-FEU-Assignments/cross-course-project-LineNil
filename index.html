            <p id="Web-security-answer">
                I would advise a potential client to do the following steps to secure themselves from web security attacks:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First make your server use HTTP and HTTPS. that makes the data between server and client encrypted.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Use a Two-factor authentication (e amil, app, text etc.) so that you must ender a code into the website for log in etc. This is in addition to a password. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Encourage the use of stron passwords. preferably with 8 digits or more and upper and lowercase letters mixed with numbers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Eventually I would recommend not to store unnecessary data. Do not store sensitive information such as card number, etc. If necessary, show as little of the card details as possible. Only just enough for the user to recognize it. For example, only the last four digits of the card number. You can also have an automatic timeout that allows the sensitive information the user has enterd on the page to be deleted if it has been left on the page for too long.
                </li>
            </ul>
